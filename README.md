Lab materials for the 4AH13 (formerly NSR04) Function Approximation Lab.


Startup procedure
-----------------

Because the linux distros on the lab computers are depreciated we will be using the Windows 7 partitions with the Spyder IDE during the lab. This being said, if you wish to do the lab on your personal computer the following instructions may not apply.

1. Open Windows 7 and log in.
2. Download the .zip file from this repo page and unzip it. If you have git installed then just clone the repo.
3. Open the Spyder IDE. Do this by clicking the start button (bottom left) and searching for Spyder then clicking the resulting application icon.
4. In the toolbar at the top:
  * Outils
    * preferences
      * editeur
        * options avancees
          - set the tab button to insert a **tabulation**
5. Open the run.py, along with any other relevent file, from the unzipped repo.
6. As you coplete your code you can execute the code by making sure the run.py script is the open tab and clicking execute or the F5 button.
